</ol>"
Application	A generic term for just about any software other than the OS.
Operating System(OS)<br>What does it do?	"The core software of a computer<br>
<ul>
  <li <="""" ol="""">Provides a User Interface.</li><li <="""" ol="""">Managers computer resources, such as the CPU and Main Memory</li><li <="""" ol="""">Determines when programs are allowed to run, and where they are loaded into memory</li><li <="""" ol="""">Determins how hardware devices communicate.</li>
</ul>"
What happens when you instruct your computer to execute a program?	"<ol>
  <li>A copy of the program is brought in from secondary memory, and stored in main memory.</li><li>The CPU read the program instructions from Main Memory.</li><li>the CPU executes the instructions, one at a time, until the program ends.</li>
</ol>"
Secondary Memory	Stores software in a relatively permanent manner.<br>eg. Hard Drives, Flash Drives.
Main Memory	The storage device that holds software while it is being processed by the CPU.<br>E.g. RAM modules.
Input/Output (I/O) devices	Allows a human to interact with the computer<br>eg. Keyboard, mouse, trackpad, monitor.
Central Processing Unit (CPU)	A devices that executes the individual commands of a program
What are the key Hardware components in a computer system?	"<ul>
  <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li><li>Input/Output(I/O) devices</li><li>Main Memory</li><li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>"
Computer System	Hardware and software components working together
Hardware Component	The physical, tangible pieces that support the computing effort.<br>eg. chips, wires, boxes/cases, keyboards, memory cards, speakers, monitors, etc.
Program	A series of instructions that the hardware executes, one after another.
Analog Information	Is continuous, in direct proportion to the source of the information.<br>ex. an alcohol thermometer rises in direct proportion to the temperature.
Digital Information	Is broken down into discrete pieces and represented as numbers
Digitized	When analog information is converted to a digital format
Bit	a single binary digit
Computer Architecture	How the hardware components of a computer are put together
Bus	A group of wires carries information between components
What hardware components make up the 'Core' of a computer?	CPU and Main Memory
Peripherals	Almost all devices in a computer system, other than the CPU and Main Memory
Controllers	Devices that coordinate the activities of specific peripherals.<br>Often handles much of the actual data transmission, allowing the CPU to focus on other activities.
Data Transfer Devices	Allow information to be sent and recieved between computers.<br>ex. Network Cards, Wifi Cards
Memory Locations	a series of small, consecutive chunks that make up the Main Memory. <br>Each is 1 Byte(8 Bits) large.
Memory Address	A unique number associated with each memory locationb
Byte	8 bits
Storage Capacity	The total number of bytes a Memory device can hold
What is an advantage of a large main memory?	It allows large, or multiple smaller, programs to fun simultaneously and efficiently.<br>This is because they dont have to retrieve data from Secondary Memory as often.
Volatile Memory	Information stored is lost when power is turned off. Main Memory is usually Volatile.
Nonvolatile Memory	Data is stored, even if the power is turned off.<br>Secondary memory is usually Nonvolatile.
Cache	a small, fast memory that stores the contents of the most frequently used Main Memory locations.<br>Used by the CPU to reduce average access time to instructions and data.
Direct/Random Access Memory	Memory that allows data to be read non-sequentially.<br>eg. Hard drives, flash drives.
Sequential Access Memory	Memory which can only allows data to be read sequentially.<br>ex. an audio tape.
Read-Only Memory	Memory which, once written to, is generally not altered.<br>ex. Your PC BIOS(Basic Input Output System), CDs.
What happens when you write data to a memory address?	It overwrites and destroys the information previously stored at that location.
What happens when you read memory from a data address?	The data is read, and left unaffected.
Control Unit	Coordinates the transfer of data between main memory and the registers.<br>Coordinates the execution of circutry in the Arithmetic\Logic Unit.
What 3 components make up a CPU?	"<ol>
  <li>The Control Unit</li><li>The Registers</li><li>The Arithmetic/Logic Unit</li>
</ol>"
Registers	Provide a small amount of memory on the CPU itself. <br>Are the smallest, fastest cache in the system.
Arithmetic/Logic Unit	Performs calculations and makes decisions.
What are the 2 reserved registers we learned? What do they do?	Instruction Register: Holds the current instruction being executed.<br>Program Counter: Holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
What is the main principle of von Neumann Architecture?	Storing both program instructions and data together in Main Memory.
What is the cycle computer continually repeat?	"Fetch-decode-execute.<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Fetch</b>&nbsp;an instruction from main memory, at the address stored in the Program Counter.<br></li><li>the program counter is incremented to prepare for the next cycle</li><li>The instruction is&nbsp;<b>Decoded</b>&nbsp;to determine how to carry it out.</li><li>The control unit&nbsp;<b>Executes</b>&nbsp;the instruction by activating the correct circuitry.</li>
</ol>"
Microprocessor	The chip the CPU is constructed on. <br>Also contains ROM chips, sockets for Controllers to connect to, and the System Clock
System Clock	A component that generates a electronic pulse at regular intervals to syncronize the events within the CPU.
Clock Speed	The rate at which the System Clock creates electronic pulses
Network	Two or more computers connected together so they can exchange information
File Server	A computer on a network that is dedicated to storing programs and data.
Point-to-point connection	Two computers connected directly through a single wire
Network Address	A unique name given to every computer on a network.<br>Similar in concept to Memory Addresses in Main Memory.
Packets	Large network messages that have been split up so they can be sent more efficiently across shared networks.
Local Area Network(LAN)	A network spanning a short distance, connecting a relatively small number of computers.<br>Convenient, reliable, and easy to install.<br>Often a single room, floor, or entire building.
Wide-Area Network(WAN)	A connection between two or more LANs.<br>One computer on each LAN is usually dedicated to communication across the WAN.
Internet	A network of networks
"Where did the term ""internet"" come from?"	The WAN concept of <i>Internetworking </i>- connecting many smaller networks together.
Protocol	A set of rules that govern how two things communicate.
TCP/IP	Two pieces of software that control how information is transmitted across the internet.<br>
Transmisson Control Protocol(TCP)	Handles problems such as pieces of information getting lost, or arriving out of order.
Internet Protocol(IP)	Defines how information is formatted and transferred from the source to the destination over the internet.
IP Address	A number that uniquely identifies all comptuers connected to the internet.
Internet Name	Another way to unqiuely identify computers on the internet; usually using characters rather than numbers.<br>eg.&nbsp;<i>hector.vt.edu</i>
Break down hector.cs.vt.edu into its component parts.	hector: The local name of the computer<br>cs: The subdomain<br>vt.edu: the domain name<br>.edu: Top-level Domain
Domain Name	The part of the URL that defines the origanization the computer belongs to.
Subdomain	A modifier added before the domain name to allow for more organization in domains, and for multiple PCs of the same name to exist on the same network.
Top-level Domain(TLD)	The last part of a domain name; .com, .edu, .ca, etc.<br>Indicates the type of organzation the computer belongs to.
Domain Name System(DNS)	The software that translates the internet address to an IP address
Domain Server	A list of all computer at a given organization, and their IP addresses.
What happens if a local domain server doesnt have the IP address for a requested Internet Name?	It contacts aother domain server that does
What 2 concepts are the Internet based on?	Hypertext and Hypermedia
Hypertext	A way to organize information so that the flow of ideas was not constrained to a linear progression.

Browser	A software tool that loads and format Web documents
Web Server	A computer dedicated to providing access to Web documents
